## Website Portfolio App made using NextJS and Tailwind CSS 

This is my first ever project built using NextJS and Tailwind CSS. It was really fun learning how to build websites faster by making use of technologies already available to me such as the aforementioned, and I look forward to learning what else I can learn to not only better streamline the process but also help make more robust and scalable projects.
